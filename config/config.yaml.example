# GENERAL ABOUT THIS CONFIG FILE:
# there are no "fallback" values,
# anything in here is required to be set to something
# a backup copy of the default file is recommended

# the way some values in this file are treeted may be unsafe
# DONT copy suspicious looking config entrys from the interwebz
# especially not non strings into boolean entrys 
# (strings are the things with "quotes" and booleans are true / false)
